Your task is to enhance the visual design of the SEO description block on all league pages in the Swish Assistant frontend. This block must remain SEO-friendly while looking more polished and integrated with the page layout.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. The SEO description block must appear directly below the league H1 and above the game carousel (do not move the carousel).
2. It must dynamically use:
   - leagueName (from the league record)
   - leagueDescription (same field currently used in the Overview tab)
3. The design must be visually improved WITHOUT changing SEO structure (keep H2 + p tags intact).

DESIGN UPGRADES TO IMPLEMENT:
- Add a soft top gradient fade so the block transitions smoothly from the banner.
- Wrap the description inside a centered card container with:
  * white background
  * slight rounded corners
  * light shadow (shadow-sm)
  * thin border using orange-100
  * padding for readability
- Add a small orange accent divider under the H2 title.
- Reduce extra space above the block so it sits closer to the H1.
- Paragraph text should be left-aligned (better readability), but the H2 remains centered.
- Ensure full width on mobile and max-w-4xl on desktop.

THE FINAL JSX BLOCK SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS (insert directly under the H1):

<div className="w-full bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-[#fffaf5] pt-4 pb-10 px-4">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm p-8 border border-orange-100">
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 text-center mb-3">
      About {leagueName}
    </h2>
    <div className="h-1 w-20 bg-orange-500 mx-auto mb-6 rounded-full"></div>
    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed text-base text-left">
      {leagueDescription}
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Locate the file responsible for rendering league pages (likely LeaguePage.tsx or similar).
- Find the existing H1 for the league title.
- Insert the JSX block immediately after the H1.
- Remove or disable any old temporary wrapper used for the SEO block.
- DO NOT remove or alter the Overview tab; it should continue to show the full league description.
- Ensure the new block updates automatically for every league slug.

WHAT TO DELIVER:
- Updated .tsx file(s) with the improved SEO description block implemented.
- Visually clean, responsive layout.
- No breaking changes to the carousel, tabs, or existing components.
