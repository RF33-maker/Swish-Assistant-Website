I’m having an issue with player profile photos in production.

Context:
- Project: Swish Assistant (React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase).
- I have a Supabase Storage bucket called `player-photos`.
- My `players` table has a `photo_path` column that stores the storage path (e.g. `player_id/primary.jpg`).
- In Supabase (production), the files are in the `player-photos` bucket and `photo_path` is correctly set for players.
- Social card templates and my Swish Social Tool use these photos correctly.
- BUT on the **player profile page** (e.g. `/player/hamza-ibrahim`), the profile pictures do not load in production.

I suspect the profile page is:
- Either not selecting `photo_path` in its Supabase query, or
- Manually building the image URL using `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` instead of using `supabase.storage.from('player-photos').getPublicUrl(photo_path)`.

I want you to FIX the player profile image logic so it consistently uses `photo_path` + `getPublicUrl`, and make sure it works in both dev and production.

### Tasks

1. **Find the player profile page component**

   - Locate the page that serves URLs like `/player/[slug]` or `/player/[id]`.
   - This is the Swish Assistant player profile page; it shows player name, team, stats, etc., and currently renders a profile avatar / header image.

2. **Update the Supabase query to include `photo_path`**

   - In the Supabase query where we fetch the player (probably something like):

     ```ts
     const { data } = await supabase
       .from("players")
       .select("id, name, team, ...")
       .eq("slug", slug)
       .single();
     ```

   - Make sure `photo_path` is included in the `.select` list:

     ```ts
     const { data } = await supabase
       .from("players")
       .select("id, name, team, photo_path, ...")
       .eq("slug", slug)
       .single();
     ```

   - Update the TypeScript type used for the player on this page to include:

     ```ts
     photo_path: string | null;
     ```

3. **Stop manually concatenating the Supabase URL**

   - On the profile page there is currently an `<img>` for the player photo that likely looks like this (or similar):

     ```tsx
     {playerInfo.playerId && playerInfo.photoPath ? (
       <img
         src={`${import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/player-photos/${playerInfo.photoPath}`}
         alt={playerInfo.name}
         ...
       />
     ) : (
       // fallback avatar
     )}
     ```

   - Remove this hard-coded string concatenation using `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`.
   - Instead, use Supabase’s `getPublicUrl` for the `player-photos` bucket.

4. **Use `supabase.storage.from('player-photos').getPublicUrl(photo_path)` on the profile page**

   - Import the Supabase client at the top of the profile page if it’s not already imported:

     ```ts
     import { supabase } from "@/supabaseClient"; // adjust path if needed
     ```

   - Create a memoized computed URL from `photo_path`:

     ```ts
     const playerPhotoUrl = useMemo(() => {
       if (!playerInfo?.photoPath) return null;

       const { data } = supabase
         .storage
         .from("player-photos")
         .getPublicUrl(playerInfo.photoPath);

       return data.publicUrl || null;
     }, [playerInfo?.photoPath]);
     ```

     Adjust property names (`photoPath` vs `photo_path`) to match whatever is used in the component state.

   - Then update the JSX where the profile image is rendered to use `playerPhotoUrl`:

     ```tsx
     {playerInfo.playerId && playerPhotoUrl ? (
       <>
         <img
           src={playerPhotoUrl}
           alt={playerInfo.name}
           className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
           style={{
             objectPosition: `50% ${
               showFocusAdjuster
                 ? tempFocusY
                 : (playerInfo.photoFocusY ?? 50)
             }%`
           }}
           onError={(e) => {
             (e.target as HTMLImageElement).style.display = "none";
           }}
         />
         {/* existing gradient overlays, keep them as they are */}
       </>
     ) : (
       // existing fallback avatar block
     )}
     ```

   - Make sure the existing gradient overlays and fallback avatar remain unchanged; only swap out how the main `<img>` `src` is constructed.

5. **Ensure consistency between `photoPath` and `photo_path`**

   - If the state object uses `photoPath` (camelCase), but the DB column is `photo_path` (snake_case), make sure you correctly map it when building `playerInfo` after the Supabase query:

     ```ts
     setPlayerInfo({
       ...,
       photoPath: data.photo_path,
       ...
     });
     ```

   - The important part is that whatever field the JSX uses (e.g. `playerInfo.photoPath`) is actually populated from the Supabase `photo_path` column, and `playerPhotoUrl` uses that same value.

6. **Do NOT touch storage policies or bucket names in code**

   - Assume the bucket is named exactly `player-photos` and already exists in the project.
   - Assume the `photo_path` values match the object paths in that bucket.
   - The fix should be purely in how the front-end builds and uses the image URL on the player profile page.

### Expected result

After these changes:

- The player profile page will:
  - Fetch `photo_path` from the `players` table.
  - Derive a public URL via `supabase.storage.from("player-photos").getPublicUrl(photo_path)`.
  - Use that URL as the `src` of the profile image.
- Player profile photos should display correctly in **both development and production**, matching the behavior I already see in my Swish Social Tool and social card templates.
