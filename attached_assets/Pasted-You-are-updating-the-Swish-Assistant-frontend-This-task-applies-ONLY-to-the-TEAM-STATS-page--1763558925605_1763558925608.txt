You are updating the Swish Assistant frontend.  
This task applies ONLY to the TEAM STATS page.

Goal:
Connect the newly added dropdowns (Category + Mode) to the team stats table so that the displayed columns change based on the selected category. 
Do NOT calculate advanced statistics yet; only wire up the column mapping.

Instructions:

1. Locate the component where the dropdown state is defined and where the team stats table receives its columns.
   Likely files:
   - TeamStatsPage.tsx
   - TeamStatsTable.tsx
   - team-columns.ts

2. Create a new object in the file that defines column groups based on the selected category:

   Example structure:
   const TEAM_STAT_COLUMNS = {
     Traditional: [ ... ],
     Advanced: [ ... ],
     FourFactors: [ ... ],
     Scoring: [ ... ],
     Misc: [ ... ]
   };

3. Populate these groups with the following columns:

   Traditional:
   - tot_spoints → "PTS"
   - tot_sfieldgoalsmade → "FGM"
   - tot_sfieldgoalsattempted → "FGA"
   - tot_sreboundstotal → "REB"
   - tot_sassists → "AST"
   - tot_ssteals → "STL"
   - tot_sblocks → "BLK"
   - tot_sturnovers → "TO"
   - tot_sfoulspersonal → "PF"
   - tot_splusminuspoints → "+/-"

   Advanced:
   - off_rating → "OFFRTG"
   - def_rating → "DEFRTG"
   - net_rating → "NETRTG"
   - pace → "PACE"

   Four Factors:
   - efg → "eFG%"
   - tov_percent → "TOV%"
   - oreb_percent → "OREB%"
   - ft_rate → "FT RATE"

   Scoring:
   - tot_spointsinthepaint → "PITP"
   - tot_spointsfastbreak → "FB PTS"
   - tot_spointssecondchance → "2ND CH"
   - tot_spointsfromturnovers → "PTS OFF TO"

   Misc:
   - tot_sreboundsoffensive → "ORB"
   - tot_sreboundsdefensive → "DRB"
   - tot_timesscoreslevel → "TIES"
   - tot_leadchanges → "LEAD CHG"

4. Update the table to use:
   const columns = TEAM_STAT_COLUMNS[category];

5. Maintain:
   - current styling
   - mobile responsiveness
   - no backend changes
   - no calculations yet

6. Return only the code changes.
