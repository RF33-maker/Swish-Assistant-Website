You are working inside the Swish Assistant web app, which uses Supabase as its backend and React (with Tailwind) for the frontend.

The database table leagues now includes a parent-child hierarchy:

league_id (uuid, primary key)

parent_league_id (uuid, nullable foreign key referencing leagues.league_id)

name, slug, logo_url, and other league info.

Each main season (e.g., "British Championship Basketball 2025/26") has parent_league_id = NULL.
Each sub-competition (e.g., "BCB Trophy 2025/26") links to its parent season using parent_league_id.

Your goal:

When building or editing frontend components that show leagues, fetch and display this hierarchy automatically.

On parent league pages (e.g., /league/[slug]), show a “Competitions” section that lists all child competitions:

const { data: competitions } = await supabase
  .from("leagues")
  .select("league_id, name, slug, logo_url")
  .eq("parent_league_id", currentLeague.league_id);


Render them as clickable cards under a “Competitions” heading.

On sub-league pages, show a breadcrumb linking back to the parent league:

const { data: parent } = await supabase
  .from("leagues")
  .select("league_id, name, slug")
  .eq("league_id", currentLeague.parent_league_id)
  .single();


Display it as:
🏀 {parent.name} → {currentLeague.name}

Rendering rules:

If a league has no parent_league_id, treat it as a main season.

If it does have one, display the breadcrumb and link to its parent.

Use Tailwind for styling (rounded-xl, p-4, shadow, hover:bg-orange-50).

Use dynamic routing based on slug (Wouter or React Router).

Example behavior:

Visiting /league/british-championship-basketball-20252026 shows:
→ “Competitions” → “BCB Trophy 2025/26” card.

Visiting /league/british-championship-basketball-trophy-2526 shows:
→ Breadcrumb “British Championship Basketball 2025/26 → Trophy 2025/26”.

Bonus:

If multiple child competitions exist (e.g., Cup, Trophy, Playoffs), display all as a grid.

For future expansion, assume this pattern repeats each season — so no hardcoding of slugs.
