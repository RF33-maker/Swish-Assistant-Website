I need you to audit my frontend codebase and report back the exact context needed to implement:
1) A new full page route: /game/:game_key (Match Centre page)
2) Update my existing score carousel to show Upcoming games when games are days out
3) Keep my existing upcoming-game preview modal, but add a CTA to open the full game page

DO NOT implement anything yet. Only investigate and report.

Please return a structured report with:

A) Routing
- What routing library am I using (wouter / react-router / next)?
- Where are routes defined (file paths)?
- What is the current route pattern for league pages and game-related views (if any)?
- How to add a new route /game/:game_key in this setup?

B) Data fetching
- Does the frontend query Supabase directly or call my backend API?
- Show the exact Supabase client file (path) or API wrapper file (path).
- Identify any existing queries to game_schedule, games, player_stats, team_stats.

C) Existing UI components (paths + how they work)
- Score carousel component:
  - file path
  - props used
  - where it’s rendered (league page/home page)
  - data it consumes (what table/endpoint)
- Upcoming game preview modal component:
  - file path
  - how it receives the selected game
  - how it currently renders info
  - how navigation would be added (button/Link)
- Any existing Game page or Game detail components:
  - file paths
  - route params used (if any)

D) Tables/fields available for upcoming games display
- Confirm which table is used for fixtures (game_schedule)
- List the fields currently used in the UI
- Identify if team logos are available and where they come from (teams table mapping? static assets?)

E) Styling constraints
- Tailwind / CSS module / styled components?
- Card layout and size constraints for the carousel (height/width)
- Any design system components used

F) Recommendation
- Based on the codebase, propose the cleanest approach to:
  1) Add /game/:game_key page (minimal MVP layout)
  2) Update the carousel to swap Results vs Upcoming based on matchtime/status
  3) Add "Open game page" CTA in the modal

Output format:
- Use bullet points
- Include file paths
- Include small code excerpts only where necessary (max 10-15 lines each)
