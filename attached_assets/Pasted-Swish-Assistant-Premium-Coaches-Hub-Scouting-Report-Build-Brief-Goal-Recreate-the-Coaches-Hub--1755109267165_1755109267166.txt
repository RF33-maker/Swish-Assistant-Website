Swish Assistant – Premium Coaches Hub & Scouting Report Build Brief
Goal
Recreate the Coaches Hub + Scouting Report flow to match the attached screenshot:

Left: Coaches Hub analytics dashboard (metrics + trends + insights).

Right: 3-pane Scouting Report editor (Blocks list → Canvas → Inspector panel).

Core Outcomes
Premium design: modern typography, athletic branding, soft shadows, rounded cards, smooth animations.

3-pane editor:

Blocks/Template list (drag/drop)

Canvas (TipTap editor with sports-specific blocks)

Inspector panel (AI assist, context, branding, export).

Fully integrated with Supabase for documents, templates, stats, and branding.

Export PDF matches the editor’s layout & theme.

Features to Implement
1. Coaches Hub (left section)
League selector with logo + status (last sync, record count).

Metric cards: Total Players, Games Tracked, Teams Tracked (with mini sparklines).

Team Performance Trends:

Clickable to open team details or create report.

Insights panel:

Colored chips (Green = improving, Red = declining, Stable = consistent).

One actionable suggestion each (e.g., “Generate Four Factors report”).

2. Scouting Report Editor (right section)
a) Left Pane – Blocks/Templates
Tabs: Blocks, Templates.

Blocks list:

Data & Context
Supabase tables:

templates (id, name, description, content, thumbnail_url)

assets (for logos/images).

Document context example:

  "game_id": "uuid",
  "home_team": "Bears",

  "venue": "City Arena",
  "colors": { "primary": "#E63946", "secondary": "#1D3557" },

  "four_factors": { "efg_home": 0.45, "efg_away": 0.52, "tov_home": 0.14, "tov_away": 0.12 }
