Your task is to update the League Page in the Swish Assistant frontend so that each league page receives an SEO-optimised introductory block directly beneath the banner and H1, and above the game carousel. This update must work dynamically for every league slug.

GOALS:
1. Move (or reuse) the existing “About This League” description already stored in Supabase.
2. Render it near the top of the page with:
   - an H2 title: “About {LeagueName}”
   - the league’s description text
   - centered container (max-width: 4xl)
   - light background, padding, and clean spacing
3. The new SEO block must appear immediately under the H1 and above:
   - the game carousel
   - the tabs navigation
4. Keep the existing Overview tab as-is; do not remove it.
5. The implementation must work for ALL league slugs with no hardcoding.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Find the React component responsible for rendering league pages (likely LeaguePage.tsx or similar).
- Locate where the H1 is rendered (e.g., “British Championship Basketball 2025–2026”).
- Insert a new JSX block directly after the H1 and before the carousel.
- Pull `leagueName` and `leagueDescription` from the same data used for the Overview tab.

REQUIRED JSX STRUCTURE (adjust styling as needed but keep structure):

<div className="w-full bg-orange-50/40 py-6 px-4 flex justify-center">
  <div className="max-w-4xl text-center">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-2">
      About {leagueName}
    </h2>
    <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">{leagueDescription}</p>
  </div>
</div>

DYNAMIC REQUIREMENTS:
- leagueName must be taken from the league record.
- leagueDescription must reuse the exact description field currently displayed inside the Overview tab content.
- No hardcoded text. All content must depend on the active league slug.

LAYOUT NOTES:
- Keep the banner at the top.
- Keep the carousel exactly where it is.
- The SEO block must appear ABOVE the carousel.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is preserved.

WHAT TO DELIVER:
- Updated .tsx file(s) with the new SEO block inserted.
- Clean, readable JSX.
- No breaking changes to existing functionality.
